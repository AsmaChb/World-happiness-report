# World Happiness Report 2017
Visualization Analysis on World Happiness Report 2017 Dataset, collected by the Gallup World Poll
This dataset includes information from more than 160 countries in over 140 languages. The main goal of this poll was to identify the key elements who drive a person's wellbeing

The main life evaluation question asked in these surveys is the following:

“Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?”

Each country is given a happiness score that is the sum of scores from the following 7 criteria

-GDP per capita

-healthy years of life expectancy

-social support (as measured by having someone to count on in times of trouble)

-trust (as measured by a perceived absence of corruption in government and business)

-perceived freedom to make life decisions

-generosity (as measured by recent donations)

-dystopia (benchmark country corresponding to the lowest possible values in each of the criteria)


#### In this project we aim to analyze the relationships between the different variables and discover underlying connections through efficient visualizations.
